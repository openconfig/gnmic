# Tunnel Server

## Introduction

`gNMIc` supports gNMI Dial-out as defined by [`openconfig/grpctunnel`](https://github.com/openconfig/grpctunnel).

`gNMIc` embeds a tunnel server to which the gNMI targets register. Once registered, `gNMIc` triggers the request gNMI RPC towards the target via the established tunnel.

This use case is described [here](https://github.com/openconfig/reference/blob/master/rpc/gnmi/gnmignoissh-dialout-grpctunnel.md#gnmi-collector-with-embedded-tunnel-server)

## Server operation

When running a Subscribe RPC using `gNMIc` with the flag `--use-tunnel-server`,`gNMIc` starts by running the Tunnel server as defined under `tunnel-server`.

The next steps depend on the type of RPC (Unary/Stream) and/or Subscribe Mode (poll/once/stream)

### Unary RPCs

`gNMIc` waits for `tunnel-server.target-wait-time` for targets to register with the tunnel server, after which it requests a new session from the server for the specified target(s) and runs the RPC through the newly established tunnel.

Note that if no target is specified, the RPC runs for all registered targets.

### Subscribe RPC

#### Poll and Once subscription

When a Poll or Once subscription are requested, `gNMIc` behaves the same way as for a unary RPC, i.e waits for targets to register then runs the RPC.

#### Stream subscription

In the case of a stream subscription, `gNMIc` triggers the Subscribe RPC as soon as a target registers.
Similarly, a stream subscription will be stopped when a target deregisters from the tunnel server.

## Configuration

```yaml
tunnel-server:
  # the address the tunnel server will listen to
  address:
  # tls config
  tls:
    # string, path to the CA certificate file,
    # this certificate is used to verify the clients certificates.
    ca-file:
    # string, server certificate file.
    cert-file:
    # string, server key file.
    key-file:
    # string, one of `"", "request", "require", "verify-if-given", or "require-verify" 
    #  - request:         The server requests a certificate from the client but does not 
    #                     require the client to send a certificate. 
    #                     If the client sends a certificate, it is not required to be valid.
    #  - require:         The server requires the client to send a certificate and does not 
    #                     fail if the client certificate is not valid.
    #  - verify-if-given: The server requests a certificate, 
    #                     does not fail if no certificate is sent. 
    #                     If a certificate is sent it is required to be valid.
    #  - require-verify:  The server requires the client to send a valid certificate.
    #
    # if no ca-file is present, `client-auth` defaults to ""`
    # if a ca-file is set, `client-auth` defaults to "require-verify"`
    client-auth: ""
  # the wait time before triggering unary RPCs or subscribe poll/once
  target-wait-time: 2s
  # enables the collection of Prometheus gRPC server metrics
  enable-metrics: false
  # enable additional debug logs
  debug: false
```

## Combining Tunnel server with a gNMI server

It is possible to start `gNMIc` with both a `gnmi-server` and `tunnel-server` enabled.

This mode allows to run gNMI RPCs against `gNMIc`'s gNMI server, they will routed to the relevant targets (`--target` flag) or to all known target (i.e registered targets)

The configuration file would look like:

```yaml
insecure: true
username: admin
password: NokiaSrl1!

subscriptions:
  sub1:
    paths:
      - /state/port
    sample-interface: 10s

gnmi-server:
  address: :57400

tunnel-server:
  address: :57401
  targets:
    - id: .*
      type: GNMI_GNOI
      config:
        subscriptions:
          - sub1
```

Running a Get RPC towards all registered targets

```bash
$ gnmic -a localhost:57400 --insecure get \
        --path /configure/system/name
[
  {
    "source": "localhost",
    "timestamp": 1646850987401608313,
    "time": "2022-03-09T10:36:27.401608313-08:00",
    "target": "sr2",
    "updates": [
      {
        "Path": "configure/system/name",
        "values": {
          "configure/system/name": "sr2"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "source": "localhost",
    "timestamp": 1646850987205206394,
    "time": "2022-03-09T10:36:27.205206394-08:00",
    "target": "sr1",
    "updates": [
      {
        "Path": "configure/system/name",
        "values": {
          "configure/system/name": "sr1"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Running a Get RPC towards a single target

```bash
$ gnmic -a localhost:57400 --insecure \
        --target sr1 \
        get --path /configure/system/name
[
  {
    "source": "localhost",
    "timestamp": 1646851044004381267,
    "time": "2022-03-09T10:37:24.004381267-08:00",
    "target": "sr1",
    "updates": [
      {
        "Path": "configure/system/name",
        "values": {
          "configure/system/name": "sr1"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
