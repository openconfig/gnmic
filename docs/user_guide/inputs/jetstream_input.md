When using jetstream as an input, `gnmic` consumes data from a specified NATS JetStream stream using a durable consumer. Messages are fetched in batches and delivered to `gnmic` in either `event` or `proto` format.

Multiple workers (subscribers) can be spawned using the `num-workers` option. Each worker independently connects to JetStream and fetches messages using the configured subject filters. All workers share the same durable consumer name to ensure coordinated message processing.

The `jetstream` input will export received messages to the configured `outputs`. Optionally, `event-processors` can be applied when using event format.

```yaml
inputs:
  js-input:
    # required string, type of input
    type: jetstream

    # optional string, input instance name
    # defaults to a generated name if empty
    name: js-consumer

    # string, NATS server address
    # default: "localhost:4222"
    address: nats.example.com:4222

    # string, name of the JetStream stream to consume from
    stream: telemetry-stream

    # list of subject filters within the stream to consume from
    subjects:
      - telemetry.device.*

    # enum string, format of consumed message: "event" or "proto"
    # default: "event"
    format: event

    # enum string, delivery policy for JetStream:
    # one of: all, last, new, last-per-subject
    # default: all
    deliver-policy: last

    # optional string, subject format used to extract metadata
    # one of: static, subscription.target, target.subscription
    # affects proto messages only
    subject-format: target.subscription

    # optional string, NATS username
    username: nats-user

    # optional string, NATS password
    password: secret

    # optional duration, reconnect wait time
    # default: 2s
    connect-time-wait: 3s

    # optional bool, enables debug logging
    debug: true

    # integer, number of workers to start (parallel consumers)
    # default: 1
    num-workers: 2

    # integer, internal per-worker buffer size
    # default: 500
    buffer-size: 1000

    # integer, batch size when fetching messages from JetStream
    # default: 500
    fetch-batch-size: 200

    # optional list of output names this input writes to
    # outputs must be configured at the root `outputs:` section
    outputs:
      - file
      - kafka

    # optional list of event processors
    # only applies when format is "event"
    event-processors:
      - add-tags

    # optional TLS configuration for secure NATS connection
    tls:
      ca-file: /etc/ssl/certs/ca.pem
      cert-file: /etc/ssl/certs/cert.pem
      key-file: /etc/ssl/certs/key.pem
      skip-verify: false
```

## Message Formats


- `event`: Expects JSON-encoded array of `EventMsg`. Supports processing pipelines and exporting to multiple outputs.

- `proto`: Expects binary-encoded `gnmi.SubscribeResponse` messages. Metadata such as `source` and `subscription-name` is extracted from the subject based on subject-format.

## Delivery Policies

- `all`: Delivers all messages from the stream history.

- `last`: Delivers only the most recent message.

- `new`: Starts delivery from new messages only.

- `last-per-subject`: Delivers the latest message for each subject.


## Subject Format Behavior

When using proto format, gnmic uses the subject name to extract metadata:

- `subscription.target` → subscription-name = first, source = second

- `target.subscription` → subscription-name = second, source = first

- `static` → no parsing; no additional metadata is extracted


## Usage Notes

- A durable consumer is created on the stream using the provided name as the durable name.

- All workers use the same durable name to share state and resume progress across reconnects.

- TLS can be configured if the NATS server uses secure connections.
